// Purpose: Configuration object for redux-persist that specifies how and where to persist the state.
// key: A unique key for the persisted data. root is commonly used for the root reducer.
// storage: Specifies the storage engine to use. In this case, it defaults to localStorage for web applications, as provided by redux-persist/lib/storage.
// version: An optional property to manage different versions of the persisted state. It allows handling migrations or changes to the state structure over time.

// Redux Store: Holds the state of your application and manages state updates through reducers and actions.
// PersistGate: Delays the rendering of your appâ€™s UI until the persisted state has been rehydrated.
// Redux Persist: A library to save and rehydrate the Redux state from persistent storage, ensuring state persistence across sessions.
// Persistor: An object that manages the persistence and rehydration process, ensuring that the state is correctly saved and restored.
